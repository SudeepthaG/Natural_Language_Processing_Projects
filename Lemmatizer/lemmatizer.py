### This program is a lemmatizer, which learns a
### lemmatization function from an annotated corpus. The function maps every word form
### attested in the training data to the most common lemma associated
### with that form. At test time, the program checks if a form is in
### the lookup table, and if so, it gives the associated lemma; if the
### form is not in the lookup table, it gives the form itself as the
### lemma (identity mapping).

### The program performs training and testing in one run: it reads the
### training data, learns the lookup table and keeps it in memory,
### then reads the test data, runs the testing, and reports the
### results.

### The program takes two command line arguments, which are the paths
### to the training and test files. Both files are assumed to be
### already tokenized, in Universal Dependencies format, that is: each
### token on a separate line, each line consisting of fields separated
### by tab characters, with word form in the second field, and lemma
### in the third field. Tab characters are assumed to occur only in
### lines corresponding to tokens; other lines are ignored.
